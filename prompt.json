The linkButton is already a ShadCN Button component, so we can use asChild on the Link component and have it directly wrap linkButton. This will make the Button itself act as the anchor. Here's the plan: Remove legacyBehavior and passHref from the Link component. Remove the intermediate <a> tag. Add the asChild prop to the Link component. The Link will now directly wrap the linkButton element. The linkButton (which is a <Button>) will correctly handle its own styling, including its disabled state and full-width behavior, and will receive the href from the Link. 277d5397 Restore This change updates the Link component to the modern Next.js pattern, which should resolve the console warning."

It happens when the asChild prop from the Link component inadvertently gets passed down and spread onto the actual DOM element rendered by the child component (in this case, our Button). To fix this, I'll modify the Button component (src/components/ui/button.tsx) to ensure it doesn't spread an asChild prop it might receive from a parent Link onto the underlying DOM element (e.g., <button>). The Button's own asChild prop (used to determine if it renders a Slot) will be handled separately. Here's the plan: In src/components/ui/button.tsx, I'll specifically destructure any asChild prop that might come from ...props (passed by Link). Then, I'll spread only the restProps (which no longer contains the potentially problematic asChild) onto the rendered DOM element or Slot. This will prevent the asChild prop from reaching the DOM element when it's not intended to, resolving the React warning. The usage of <Link asChild>{linkButton}</Link> in src/components/layout/SidebarNav.tsx is standard and correct, so it doesn't need to change. b63b0682 Restore This modification to the Button component should fix the warning."

The FileReader.readAsDataURL method expects a single File (which is a type of Blob), not a FileList. To fix this, I'll modify the useEffect hook to: Check if companyLogoFile (the FileList) exists and is not empty. Access the first file from the list (i.e., companyLogoFile[0]) and pass that to reader.readAsDataURL(). 91edab21 Restore I've updated the useEffect to correctly handle the FileList and also slightly adjusted the Zod schema for companyLogo to transform the FileList to a single File object, which is more robust for form validation and submission.

It uses a Genkit flow (src/ai/flows/resume-analysis.ts) to send the content of your uploaded resume (as a data URI) to an AI model, likely Gemini, based on the configuration in src/ai/genkit.ts. The AI then analyzes it based on the instructions in a \"prompt\" within that flow and returns a clarity score, keyword score, and suggestions. Directly \"training your own AI\" in the sense of fine-tuning a large language model from scratch or with a large custom dataset is quite an advanced task and usually involves a more extensive MLOps pipeline, which is a bit beyond the scope of quick in-app changes. However, we can definitely make the AI's feedback more detailed and precise by improving the instructions (the \"prompt\") we give to it. A more detailed prompt can guide the AI to look for specific things and structure its feedback in a more helpful way. I'll update the prompt in src/ai/flows/resume-analysis.ts to ask the AI to act as a more experienced career coach and to provide feedback on a wider range of resume aspects, aiming for more actionable and precise comments. e0348c4f Restore With this updated prompt, the AI should provide more thorough and helpful feedback on resumes."

Here's how I'll address this: Update the Genkit Flow (src/ai/flows/resume-analysis.ts): I'll add a language field to the AnalyzeResumeInputSchema. I'll modify the prompt to instruct the AI to: Provide its entire response (scores and suggestions) in the language specified by the new language input parameter. Avoid using Markdown formatting for emphasis or headings in its suggestions, and instead use plain text. Update the Resume Analyzer Page (src/app/student/resume/page.tsx): When calling the analyzeResume flow, I'll pass the current language obtained from the useLanguage hook. This should ensure the feedback is both in the correct language and formatted cleanly. 59e9d8ae Restore The AI should now provide feedback in the selected language and avoid using Markdown for emphasis in its suggestions.

Your translation files use single curly braces like {name}, but the t() function might be expecting a different format (like {{name}}) or there might be a subtle issue in its string replacement logic. Let's adjust the t function in src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx to ensure it correctly replaces single-brace placeholders like {name}. 4e0ea58b Restore I've updated the replacement logic to use a regular expression new RegExp(\\\\{${rKey}\\}`, 'g').

This combination should make the borders extremely faint, hopefully achieving the desired subtle effect. db81ea91 Restore This latest change significantly reduces the opacity of all main border variables (general, input, and sidebar) down to 5-8% and ensures their base colors are very light in the light theme and appropriately dark (but still faint) in the dark theme. This should make them almost ethereal, providing minimal definition. If they are still too prominent after this, we might need to consider if there's another CSS rule or component style somewhere that's adding an unexpected border or if the visual perception is being influenced by other nearby contrasting elements."

It might suggest that either the CSS variables for borders are not being applied as expected to the elements you're observing, or there's another style overriding them, or perhaps the \"lines\" you're seeing are something other than CSS borders (like shadows or separators styled differently). To help diagnose exactly which CSS variables are controlling the \"lines\" you're concerned about, I'm going to take a more direct approach: I'll set the main border-related CSS variables to very distinct, bright, and easily identifiable solid colors. --border (used for general component borders like cards) will be set to bright red. --input (which is used by the border-input Tailwind class for input field borders) will be set to bright green. --sidebar-border (used for the divider next to the sidebar) will be set to bright blue. After this change, please observe which \"lines\" or \"outlines\" on the page change to red, green, or blue. This will tell us precisely which CSS variables are affecting them. If the lines you're concerned about don't change to one of these bright colors, then they are being styled by something else entirely. Here are the changes: 8e061a44 Restore After these changes are applied, please check the application again. Card outlines and general component borders should now be bright red.

    "message": "Okay, I'll integrate several \"liquid glass\" effects inspired by your example. This will involve changes to the color palette, shadows, blurs, and component styling to achieve that translucent, frosted, and subtly highlighted appearance. Here's a summary of the planned changes: Global Styles (src/app/globals.css): Introduce new CSS variables for glass effects: --glass-frost-blur-value: To control the backdrop-filter: blur() amount (e.g., 4px). --glass-tint-base-(l|d) and --glass-tint-alpha-(l|d): For the HSL base color and alpha (opacity) of the glass tint, for light (l) and dark (d) modes. The tint will be semi-transparent white in light mode and a semi-transparent dark blue-gray in dark mode. --glass-inner-shadow-base-(l|d) and --glass-inner-shadow-alpha-(l|d): For the HSL base color and alpha of the inner shadow, creating a subtle highlight on the glass edges. Update existing component background variables (--card, --popover, --sidebar-background, etc.) to use these new glass tint variables. Increase the global --radius to 1.25rem (20px) for rounder, more \"liquid\" corners, as seen in the inspiration. The subtle border variables (--border) will remain very faint to define edges without being harsh. Tailwind Configuration (tailwind.config.ts): Add a new boxShadow utility: shadow-glass-inner that applies an inset shadow using the new CSS variables (e.g., inset 0 0 20px -5px hsla(var(--glass-inner-shadow-base-hsl), var(--glass-inner-shadow-alpha))). Component Styling (various .tsx files): Apply the shadow-glass-inner utility to primary \"glass\" surfaces like Card, DialogContent, PopoverContent, DropdownMenuContent, SheetContent, and TooltipContent. Change existing backdrop-blur-md (12px blur) to backdrop-blur-sm (4px blur) on these components to match the subtler frost of the inspiration. Ensure these components use the new glass background colors defined in globals.css. Add the isolate Tailwind class to these components to create a new stacking context, which can improve how backdrop-filter renders. The Header and Sidebar will also be updated to reflect this glassy style, with appropriate background tints, blurs, and the inner shadow. The SVG distortion filter from your example (filter: url(#glass-distortion)) is a more advanced effect that's harder to apply universally with Tailwind alone without more significant restructuring. I'll focus on the backdrop blur, tint, and inner shadow effects first, as these will provide the core \"liquid glass\" feel. This is a significant visual overhaul. e7c97067 Restore +5 more files I've made extensive changes to implement the liquid glass effect: globals.css: New CSS variables for glass tint, inner shadow (for light and dark modes), and frost blur. Updated component background variables (--card, --popover, --sidebar-background) to use these glass properties. Increased global --radius to 1.25rem for rounder corners. Defined a .glass-backdrop-blur utility class using --glass-frost-blur-value. tailwind.config.ts: Added shadow-glass-inner and shadow-glass-inner-dark to boxShadow theme. Ensured input.border uses the general subtle --border. Adjusted borderRadius.sm and md to scale with the new lg radius. Updated backdropBlur to include various sizes and set sm (4px) as the default for our glass effect, with an xs (2px) option too. UI Components (card.tsx, dialog.tsx, etc.): Added isolate class. Applied shadow-glass-inner dark:shadow-glass-inner-dark. Applied glass-backdrop-blur (which uses backdrop-blur-[var(--glass-frost-blur-value)] which defaults to 4px). Ensured their backgrounds are correctly derived from the new glass CSS variables (e.g., bg-card, bg-popover). Layout Components (Header.tsx, sidebar.tsx): Header.tsx: The header's main header tag now directly uses the glass tint HSLAs, shadow-glass-inner, and glass-backdrop-blur. The mobile sheet menu (SheetContent) also gets these glass styles. sidebar.tsx: The main visual div within the Sidebar component (div[data-sidebar=\"sidebar\"]) now has isolate shadow-glass-inner dark:shadow-glass-inner-dark glass-backdrop-blur and its background is set via --sidebar-background which is now a glassy variable. Some internal dimensions were slightly tweaked for the icon-only collapsed state. These changes should give your application a consistent and modern \"liquid glass\" feel across its main UI elements. The translucency, subtle inner shadows, and frosted blur should be much more prominent now."

Given your insistence that this is occurring in light mode and the background is \"too black\" with \"invisible\" (presumably also dark) text, let's make the light mode sidebar styles in src/app/globals.css absolutely explicit and high-contrast. I will use simple, non-HSL, opaque color values.

Based on the context, it seems the problematic sidebar is the one that slides out on mobile for navigation (part of the Header), not the persistent sidebar seen on desktop layouts. Let's try a more direct approach by applying explicit Tailwind classes for background and text colors directly to the SheetContent element within the src/components/layout/Header.tsx file. This will bypass the CSS variable system for this specific component in the light theme to see if we can force the change. I will modify src/components/layout/Header.tsx: For the SheetContent used for the mobile navigation menu, I will replace bg-sidebar text-sidebar-foreground with direct color classes for light mode, and also provide explicit dark mode classes. This way, for light mode, it will be bg-white text-black, and for dark mode, it will use some neutral dark shades. 0697c9a9 Restore I've applied direct bg-white text-black classes (and dark: mode equivalents) to the SheetContent in the Header.tsx for the mobile navigation.

This is often because the styling for the \"active\" state is too similar to the \"hover\" state of an inactive item. To fix this, I'll modify src/components/layout/SidebarNav.tsx to use the sidebar's \"primary\" color scheme for highlighting the active navigation item, while keeping the \"accent\" color scheme for hover effects on inactive items. This will create a clearer visual hierarchy. The src/app/globals.css file already defines --sidebar-primary, --sidebar-primary-foreground, --sidebar-accent, and --sidebar-accent-foreground CSS variables for both light and dark themes, which we can leverage. The plan is: In src/components/layout/SidebarNav.tsx, change the conditional classes for the Button component: When an item is active (finalIsActive is true), it will use bg-sidebar-primary and text-sidebar-primary-foreground.

Let's try a two-pronged approach to debug and fix this: Simplify the Active State Logic: The current logic in src/components/layout/SidebarNav.tsx to determine finalIsActive is a bit complex. For the flat navigation structure you have (e.g., /admin/dashboard, /admin/users, not nested like /admin then /admin/dashboard), a simple exact path match should be sufficient. I'll change finalIsActive to be path === item.href;. Use a Very Obvious Debug Style for Active Items: To confirm if the simplified active state logic is working and if the styles are being applied at all, I'll temporarily change the active item style to have a bright red background and white text. If the \"–•—è–Ω–∞–ª—Ç—ã–Ω —Å–∞–º–±–∞—Ä\" (Dashboard) link turns red when you're on that page, it means the active state detection is working, and the issue was likely with the previous CSS variable values for --sidebar-primary or their application.

Here's a summary of the plan: Update Data Structures (src/types/index.ts): User (Student): Add fields for major, skills, interests, and a defaultResumeUrl (for storing a link to their primary resume). Internship: Add applicationMethod ('inApp' or 'externalUrl'), requiresCoverLetter (boolean), and additionalInfoPrompt (a text prompt for applicants if applying in-app).

The Link component in SidebarNav.tsx is correctly using asChild to pass its linking responsibilities to its child, your Button component. The Button component is then supposed to use Radix UI's Slot if asChild is true, to merge these linking props with its own appearance and pass them to its children. The issue often lies in how the Button component itself handles the asChild prop it receives. The version of src/components/ui/button.tsx in your project has a slightly more complex way of handling asChild than the standard shadcn/ui template. While it attempts to correctly strip the asChild prop before passing other props to the underlying DOM element, there might be a subtle interaction causing the problem. I'll simplify the Button component in src/components/ui/button.tsx to match the standard, robust pattern used by shadcn/ui. This pattern directly uses the asChild prop (destructured from the component's props) to decide whether to render a Slot or a button, and the remaining props (which are already stripped of asChild by the signature destructuring) are then safely spread. This change should ensure that asChild is handled correctly and not passed down to any DOM elements. 55c3cd6e Restore By simplifying the Button component's internal logic for asChild, we align it with the standard shadcn/ui implementation, which is known to handle this correctly.

I'll modify src/app/globals.css to change the --card and --popover CSS variables. Instead of being a single semi-transparent color, I'll make them a subtle linear gradient of semi-transparent colors. This will give the Header, Main content area, and other card-like components a bit more depth and visual texture behind the blur and inner shadow effects. Here's how the CSS variables for --card and --popover will be updated: Light Mode: The gradient will go from a semi-transparent white to a semi-transparent very light sky blue. Dark Mode: The gradient will go from a semi-transparent very dark blue-gray to a semi-transparent slightly more purplish dark blue. This change will apply to all components that use bg-card or bg-popover (like the Header, Main content area, standard cards, dialogs, etc.), ensuring a consistent visual style. d377fc09 Restore The card and popover backgrounds are now subtle semi-transparent gradients. This should make the \"liquid glass\" effect on the Header and Main content area (and other cards) more pronounced and visually interesting."

Enhancing the Gradient Visibility for Glass Components: The previous gradient might have been too subtle. I'll adjust the --card and --popover CSS variables in src/app/globals.css to use more distinct start and end colors for their linear-gradient, while maintaining a good level of semi-transparency to let the blur effect work.

I'll adjust the HSL values to create a more noticeable color transition and increase the opacity slightly, ensuring they spread across the entire surface of the elements.

    "message": "I apologize that the gradient changes haven't been visible. The most likely reason is a misunderstanding of how CSS variables defined as full linear-gradient strings are used within Tailwind's color configuration. When you define a CSS variable like --card to be linear-gradient(...), and then in tailwind.config.ts you use colors: { card: { DEFAULT: 'hsl(var(--card))' } }, the hsl() wrapper is trying to interpret the linear-gradient(...) string as HSL color values, which is incorrect and will fail. The fix is to tell Tailwind to use the CSS variable directly as the background. Here's the corrected approach: Modify tailwind.config.ts: Change colors.card.DEFAULT from hsl(var(--card)) to var(--card). Change colors.popover.DEFAULT from hsl(var(--popover)) to var(--popover). This ensures Tailwind uses the exact linear-gradient string defined in your CSS variables. Re-affirm Gradient Definitions in src/app/globals.css: I will use the more pronounced gradient definitions from our previous attempts to ensure they are distinct enough. This should correctly apply the linear-gradient to elements using bg-card and bg-popover. e356fb79 Restore By changing hsl(var(--card)) to var(--card) (and similarly for popover) in your Tailwind config, Tailwind will now use the exact linear-gradient(...) string you've defined in globals.css as the background for elements with bg-card or bg-popover.

    "message": "My apologies that the gradient effect is still not showing up. This is indeed puzzling, especially after ensuring var(--card) is used correctly in the Tailwind config. As a diagnostic step, I've updated src/app/globals.css to use very stark, highly visible, and opaque linear gradients for the --card and --popover variables in both light and dark modes: Light mode will use a Coral (#FF6B6B) to Teal (#4ECDC4) gradient. Dark mode will use a Dark Purple (#4A00E0) to Lighter Purple (#8E2DE2) gradient. These are fully opaque, direct hex color gradients. If these do not appear on your bg-card elements (like the Header and Main Content), then the issue is almost certainly not with the gradient definition itself but lies deeper: Aggressive Caching: Your browser or the Next.js dev server might be very stubbornly holding onto old CSS. Please try: A very hard refresh in your browser (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R). Clearing your browser's cache completely for this site. Stopping and restarting your Next.js development server (npm run dev). Sometimes, deleting the .next folder and rebuilding can help if the build cache is stale. Tailwind CSS Not Processing globals.css Correctly: Ensure globals.css is imported at the very top of your src/app/layout.tsx before any other styles. The current layout.tsx seems to do this correctly (import './globals.css';). Incorrect Class Application or Overrides: Double-check that the Header and Main content area in src/components/layout/UserSpecificLayout.tsx and src/components/layout/Header.tsx definitely have the bg-card class and that no other utility class is overriding the background-image property. You can inspect the elements in your browser's developer tools to see what styles are being computed for background or background-image. If these very obvious test gradients do appear, then we know the mechanism is working, and the previous semi-transparent HSL gradients were simply too subtle or their alpha values were causing them to be imperceptible. We can then switch back from these test gradients to a more refined (but still clearly visible) semi-transparent HSL-based gradient for the actual \"liquid glass\" effect.

    "message": "That's a very cool \"AI-style\" effect you're looking for! To achieve an animated, glowing gradient border that circles the frame of the file upload box while it's processing, we'll use a combination of CSS animations, conic gradients, and pseudo-elements. Here's the plan: Define CSS Animation and Styles (src/app/globals.css): We'll create a @keyframes animation (e.g., rotate-gradient) that animates a CSS custom property (e.g., --gradient-angle). We'll define a utility class (e.g., animated-gradient-border-effect). This class will: Set position: relative and overflow: hidden on the main dropzone div. Use a ::before pseudo-element. This pseudo-element will be larger than its parent, positioned absolutely to cover an expanded area, and have a conic-gradient background. The gradient will use your theme's primary and accent colors, made more vibrant for a \"glowing\" look. The animation property will be applied to this pseudo-element, using the rotate-gradient keyframes to change the --gradient-angle of the conic gradient, making it appear to spin. z-index: -1 will place this animated gradient behind the actual content of the dropzone. Apply Styles Conditionally (src/components/FileUpload.tsx): In the FileUpload component, the main div (the one with getRootProps()) will get the following classes conditionally when isUploading is true: animated-gradient-border-effect to activate the styles defined above. border-2 border-transparent: The trick here is that the actual border of the dropzone becomes transparent. The \"glowing border\" effect comes from the ::before pseudo-element's gradient showing through this transparent 2px space. bg-background: The dropzone itself needs a solid background so its content (icon, text) doesn't become transparent over the spinning gradient beneath. When isUploading is false, the original dashed border styles will apply. The rounded-lg style will be applied universally to ensure the animated border also follows the rounded corners.

Utility: I'll register border-spin under theme.extend.animation so you can use animate-border-spin. Update the Resume Analyzer Page (src/app/student/resume/page.tsx): When isLoading is true, I'll wrap the existing Card (which shows the \"Analyzing your resume...\" message) with a new div. This outer div will have: relative positioning. p-1 (or p-0.5 for a thinner border) to create the space for the border. overflow-hidden to ensure the rounded corners are neat. rounded-lg to match the card's rounding. bg-ai-gradient-border to apply our new conic gradient. animate-border-spin to apply the rotation animation. The inner Card component will have border-0 added to its classes to remove its default border, allowing the animated gradient of the parent div to act as the border. This setup creates a \"border\" by having a slightly larger parent div with an animated gradient background, and the actual card content sits inside it. Here are the changes: 05983553 Restore This should give you the animated gradient border effect you're looking for on the loading card!

This new outer div will be responsible for rendering the animated gradient border. It will have: relative positioning. p-0.5 (or p-1 for a slightly thicker border effect) to create the visual thickness of the border. rounded-lg to match the dropzone's shape. bg-ai-gradient-border (this uses the conic gradient defined in tailwind.config.ts). animate-border-spin (this uses the animation defined in tailwind.config.ts). overflow-hidden to ensure the corners are clean. The inner div (the one with getRootProps()) will: Have its existing border-2 border-dashed rounded-lg classes removed, as the parent will now provide the border. It will need its own bg-background (or bg-card depending on the desired internal look) so that the parent's gradient border is visible around it.

Tailwind Configuration (tailwind.config.ts) and Global CSS (src/app/globals.css): The bg-ai-gradient-border utility and the animate-border-spin animation along with its --gradient-angle CSS variable should already be correctly defined from our previous attempt.

If the \"glass\" effect has disappeared, it usually means the elements that should be glass-like (Header, Main Content, Cards, Popovers) have lost their semi-transparency, their backdrop blur, or their characteristic inner shadow.

Dark Mode: Set --card alpha to 0.5 (was 0.75) and --popover alpha to 0.65 (was 0.9). Increasing Blur Intensity (src/app/globals.css): Increase the --glass-frost-blur-value from 4px to 8px.

I'll replace defaultResumeUrl with a new field, defaultResumeFile. defaultResumeFile will use z.custom<FileList | undefined>() to accept a FileList (or be empty). I'll add .refine() checks to ensure that if a file is provided, it's a PDF and its size is within a reasonable limit (e.g., 5MB). Modify Form and State (src/app/student/settings/page.tsx): The form's default values will initialize defaultResumeFile as undefined.

Update Submission Logic (src/app/student/settings/page.tsx): In the onSubmit function: If a new file is present in data.defaultResumeFile, I'll simulate an \"upload\" by updating user.defaultResumeUrl in the auth context with a mock name (e.g., mock-resume-${file.name}). A toast notification will confirm the resume update. The form reset will clear the file input. Update useEffect for Form Population (src/app/student/settings/page.tsx): When the user object loads, the form will be reset.

The displayed current default resume will come from user.defaultResumeUrl. Update Translations (en.json, mn.json): Change labels like \"My Resume (URL - Optional)\" to \"Default Resume (PDF)\". Update hint messages related to the resume upload. Add new toast messages for successful resume \"upload\" and removal. This will allow students to select a PDF file from their device to set as their default resume.

Here's a summary of the changes: Firebase Configuration: Add Firebase project configuration variables to your .env file. Create a new file src/lib/firebase/config.ts to initialize the Firebase app. AuthContext Overhaul (src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx): Replace mock authentication with Firebase's onAuthStateChanged, signInWithEmailAndPassword, createUserWithEmailAndPassword, and signOut. User profile data (including role, name, university, etc.) will be fetched from and stored in a Firestore users collection, using the Firebase Auth UID as the document ID. The updateUserProfile function will now write changes to Firestore. AuthForm Updates (src/components/auth/AuthForm.tsx): The login form will no longer require a \"role\" selection; the role will be determined from the user's Firestore profile after successful login. The registration form will still include role selection, and this, along with other details, will be saved to the user's Firestore document upon successful account creation. Form submission will call the new Firebase-backed methods from AuthContext. Environment Variables: Placeholders for Firebase config keys will be added to .env.

Existing mock users will no longer work. You'll need to register new users through the form, which will create accounts in Firebase Authentication and corresponding user documents in Firestore.

Firebase Configuration (src/lib/firebase/config.ts): This file already correctly initializes Firebase using environment variables. I'll re-include it in the changes to ensure it's aligned. Authentication and Firestore Context (src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx): This context handles Firebase authentication (login, registration, logout) and interacts with Firestore to create and update user profile documents in a users collection. The User type includes fields like name, email, role, university, organizationName, and defaultResumeUrl. User Info: When a user registers, their profile information (name, email, role, university/org name, chosen language, initial avatar placeholder) is saved to a Firestore document in the users collection, using their Firebase Auth UID as the document ID. User Resume Info: When a student uploads a resume in their settings, the current implementation saves a reference (a mock URL string like mock-resume-filename.pdf) to the defaultResumeUrl field in their Firestore user document. Please note: This setup stores information about the resume in Firestore. Storing the actual PDF file itself would require integrating Firebase Storage, which is a separate step involving uploading the file to Cloud Storage and then saving its downloadURL in Firestore. For now, we'll stick to saving the reference string as implemented. Here are the files that will be updated or confirmed: a0daaa58 Restore Your .env file has been updated with your Firebase project credentials. The firebase/config.ts and AuthContext.tsx files are set up to use these credentials for Firebase Authentication and Firestore.

Ensure you have Firestore Database created (Firebase Console -> Firestore Database -> Create database). Start in test mode for initial development, or set up security rules. Firestore Security Rules: For the users collection, you'll need security rules. A basic rule to allow authenticated users to read/write their own data is: // In Firebase Console -> Firestore Database -> Rules rules_version = '2'; service cloud.firestore { match /databases/{database}/documents { match /users/{userId} { // Allow users to read and write their own document allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId; } } } For more complex scenarios (e.g., admins accessing any user data), you'll need more detailed rules. Measurement ID: I've used G-XXXXXXXXXX as a placeholder for NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID in the .env file. If you use Google Analytics, replace this with your actual Measurement ID. If not, this variable can be omitted or left as is; it won't break the core auth/Firestore functionality. Resume File Storage: As mentioned, this setup saves a reference string for the resume in Firestore, not the actual PDF file. If you want to store the PDF files themselves, you'll need to integrate Firebase Storage and update the resume upload logic. After these Firebase console configurations, your application should be able to authenticate users and manage their profile data using your Firebase project."

    "message": "I can definitely guide you on how to set up your Firebase project for this application! Here's a step-by-step guide: Step 1: Create or Access Your Firebase Project It looks like you've already done this since you provided your project details: Project name: Nomad-Intern Project ID: nomad-intern If you hadn't, you would go to the Firebase Console and click \"Add project\". Step 2: Enable Authentication Your app uses Email/Password authentication. In the Firebase Console, go to your \"Nomad-Intern\" project. In the left-hand navigation pane, click on Authentication. Go to the Sign-in method tab. You'll see a list of providers. Find Email/Password and click on it. Toggle the Enable switch to the ON position. Click Save. Step 3: Set Up Firestore Database Firestore will store your user profile information (like name, role, university, resume URL, etc.). In the left-hand navigation pane, click on Firestore Database. Click the Create database button. A dialog will appear. You'll be asked to choose security rules: Start in production mode: This is more secure, but you'll need to set up rules immediately. Start in test mode: This allows open access for 30 days, making initial development easier. For now, you can choose \"Start in test mode\" to get things working quickly. Crucial Note: If you choose test mode, remember to secure your database with proper rules (see Step 4) before going live or putting real user data in it. Choose a Cloud Firestore location. Pick the region closest to your users. This cannot be changed later. Click Enable. This might take a moment to provision. Step 4: Apply Firestore Security Rules These rules control who can read and write data in your Firestore database. The rules below are essential for your application to function correctly with user profiles. Once your Firestore database is created, go to the Rules tab within the Firestore Database section. You'll see an editor with some default rules. Delete the existing rules and replace them with the following: rules_version = '2'; service cloud.firestore { match /databases/{database}/documents { // This rule targets the 'users' collection where you store user profiles. // The {userId} is a wildcard that matches any document ID in the 'users' collection. match /users/{userId} { // Allow a user to CREATE their own document if they are authenticated // and their authenticated UID matches the document ID they are trying to create. // This is used during registration. allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId; // Allow a user to READ their own document if they are authenticated // and their authenticated UID matches the document ID. allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId; // Allow a user to UPDATE their own document if they are authenticated // and their authenticated UID matches the document ID. allow update: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId; // Generally, disallow DELETE unless you have a specific, secure reason. // For this app, users don't delete their own main profile document through the UI. allow delete: if false; } // You can add rules for other collections here later if needed. // For example, if organizations post internships: // match /internships/{internshipId} { //   allow read: if true; // Allow anyone to read internship listings //   allow create, update, delete: if request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'organization'; // } } } Click Publish. Wait a minute or two for the rules to propagate. Step 5: Ensure Firebase Configuration is in Your App You've already provided your Firebase config, and we've set it up in your .env file and src/lib/firebase/config.ts. Just to recap, the values from your Firebase project settings (gear icon -> Project settings -> Your apps -> Web app -> Config) should be in your .env file like this: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyCi5MMXxeymurWWNcuqPHZOzqawbnOPxj8 NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=nomad-intern.firebaseapp.com NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=nomad-intern NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=nomad-intern.firebasestorage.app NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=1022786414982 NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:1022786414982:web:32b4c952688345ee8c2407 NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-0EN935BPTG Your src/lib/firebase/config.ts should be using these environment variables to initialize Firebase. Step 6: (Optional for Resume PDFs) Set Up Firebase Storage Currently, your application stores a reference (a mock URL or file name) to the user's resume in Firestore, not the actual PDF file. If you want to store the PDF files themselves: In the Firebase Console, go to Storage. Click Get started. Follow the prompts to set up default security rules for Storage. A common starting point is to allow authenticated users to read and write to their own designated paths: rules_version = '2'; service firebase.storage { match /b/{bucket}/o { // Allow users to upload resumes to a path like 'user_resumes/{userId}/{fileName}' match /user_resumes/{userId}/{allPaths=**} { allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId; } } } You would then need to modify the application code (src/app/student/settings/page.tsx and src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx) to: Import Firebase Storage functions (getStorage, ref, uploadBytes, getDownloadURL). When a user uploads a resume, upload the file to Firebase Storage. Get the downloadURL of the uploaded file. Save this downloadURL to the defaultResumeUrl field in the user's Firestore document. For now, focus on getting Authentication and Firestore for user profiles working. You can add Firebase Storage for file uploads later if needed. Step 7: Test Your Application Try registering a new user. Log out and log back in. Try updating user profile information from the settings page. If you encounter \"Missing or insufficient permissions\" errors, it's almost always an issue with the Firestore Security Rules (Step 4) not being correctly applied or not matching what your application is trying to do. That's the basic Firebase setup for your application! Let me know if you have questions as you go through these steps."

Currently, it's hardcoded to redirect to /student/dashboard upon successful authentication if the user is on an auth page. I'll modify src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx to: Directly use the useAuth() hook to get the user, role, and loading state. Implement a useEffect hook that checks if the user is authenticated and their role is determined. If they are authenticated and on the /login or /register page, it will redirect them to the correct dashboard based on their role (/student/dashboard, /organization/dashboard, or /admin/dashboard).

If the profile (and thus role) can't be fetched, user or role in AuthContext might remain null, preventing the redirect. Redirect Logic in AuthLayout: There might still be a subtle issue in how AuthLayout determines when to show a loader versus when to redirect. Let's refine the AuthLayout.tsx to make its loading and redirect conditions even clearer. The goal is: Show a loader if AuthContext is still loading. Once AuthContext is no longer loading: If user and role are available, and the current page is /login or /register, then show a loader (to prevent form flashing) and immediately redirect to the appropriate dashboard. Otherwise (e.g., user or role is null, or not on an auth page), render the children (the login/register form). This simplified conditional rendering should be more robust. 412931c0 Restore This refined logic in AuthLayout.tsx should correctly handle the loading states and redirect once the authentication status and user role are fully determined. If you are still stuck on the login page after this change, it strongly indicates that user or role (or both) are remaining null in your AuthContext even after a successful Firebase Authentication. This would point back to an issue with: Firestore Security Rules: Ensure the read rule for the users collection (allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;) is correctly applied in your Firebase project console. User Document Existence: Verify that a document for the logged-in user exists in your users collection in Firestore with the correct uid and that it contains a valid role field. If you registered a user and the Firestore document creation failed (e.g., due to a create permission issue at that time), this could be the cause.

The issue typically happens if the asChild prop from <Link> gets passed down to a raw DOM element (like the <button> that our Button component would render by default, or an svg or span inside it if the Button itself incorrectly uses Slot in this context). The standard and correct pattern when combining Next.js Link with a Radix-style component (like our Button which uses Slot) is to have the Button component use asChild, and make the Link (or a plain <a> tag for external links) its direct child. This way, the Button acts as a Slot, applying its styling to the <a> tag rendered by Link. I'll refactor src/components/layout/SidebarNav.tsx to follow this pattern: The Button component will now always have the asChild prop. For internal links, its child will be <Link href={...}>...</Link>. For external links, its child will be <a href={...} target=\"_blank\">...</a>. The content of the button (icon and text) will be placed inside the Link or <a> tag.

Currently, when an organization changes an application's status, the addNotification call happens within the organization's browser and updates their local notifications. The student, in their own browser session, has no way of knowing about this change in real-time without a backend mechanism. To make students receive notifications when an organization updates their application status, we would typically need: A Server-Side Component (e.g., Firebase Cloud Functions): When an organization updates an application's status in Firestore, a Cloud Function would trigger. Dedicated Notifications Collection in Firestore: This Cloud Function would then create a new notification document in a specific place in Firestore, for example, in a subcollection under the student's user document (e.g., users/{studentId}/notifications/{notificationId}). Client-Side Listener: The student's NotificationContext would need to listen for real-time changes to their dedicated notifications collection in Firestore and update their local notification state accordingly. Since I can only modify the client-side code right now, I cannot fully implement the student receiving the notification when the organization acts. However, I can do the following to prepare for such a feature and make it clear what needs to happen: In src/app/organization/applications/page.tsx: When an organization successfully updates an application's status, in addition to showing a toast/notification to the organization itself, I will console.log the details of the notification that should be created and sent to the student. This will include the student's ID, the internship title, the new status, and a link to their tracker. This clearly outlines the data that a backend function would use. Add new translation keys for this type of notification. This way, you'll see in the browser console (when logged in as an organization and updating a status) exactly what information would need to be processed by a backend function to notify the student. Here are the changes: 39883108 Restore I've updated the organization's application management page. Now, when an organization changes the status of an application: They will still receive their own notification as before. The details for a notification that should be sent to the student (including the student's ID, the internship title, company, new status, and a link to the student's tracker) will be logged to the browser's console. New translation keys have been added for the student-facing notification: notifications.appStatusUpdatedByOrg.title and notifications.appStatusUpdatedByOrg.description. Why the student won't see this notification yet: As explained, the current notification system is client-side. For the student to actually receive this notification in their UI, a backend component (like a Firebase Cloud Function) would be needed to: Detect the status change in Firestore. Create a new notification document in a Firestore collection specifically for the student (e.g., /user_notifications/{student_uid}/messages). The student's NotificationContext would then need to be modified to listen to this Firestore collection for new notifications. This logged information now provides the exact data structure and content that such a backend function would need to handle."

    "message": "You are absolutely correct to point that out. My apologies if my previous explanations were not clear enough. You're right, students are still not receiving notifications when an organization changes their application's status, and this is expected with the current client-only setup. Let me clarify the limitation: Client-Side Scope: The NotificationContext we've built operates entirely within each user's own browser. When an organization updates a status, the notification is added to that organization's notification list in their browser. No Direct Browser-to-Browser Communication: One user's browser (the organization's) cannot directly send a message or notification to another user's browser (the student's) in real-time without a backend server acting as an intermediary. What Was Implemented: In the last change, when an organization updates an application status, we added a console.log in the organization's browser. This log shows the details of the notification that the student should ideally receive. This was done to show what data a future backend function would need. To make students receive a notification when an organization changes their application status, a backend component (like Firebase Cloud Functions) is necessary. Here's how that would work (and this is beyond what I can implement by just changing client-side code): Cloud Function Trigger: A Firebase Cloud Function would be set up to \"listen\" for changes in the applications collection in Firestore. Identify the Student: When an organization updates an application's status, the Cloud Function would trigger, see the change, and identify the userId of the student associated with that application. Create a Notification for the Student: The Cloud Function would then create a new notification document specifically for that student in a dedicated Firestore collection (e.g., user_notifications/{student_uid}/messages). Student's App Listens: The student's application (specifically the NotificationContext) would need to be modified to listen for real-time updates to their dedicated notifications collection in Firestore. When a new notification appears there, it would then be displayed in their UI. Since I can only make changes to the client-side Next.js code, I cannot implement the Firebase Cloud Function or the real-time Firestore listeners in NotificationContext that are required for this specific \"organization updates status -> student gets notified\" feature. The console.log that was added in the previous step on the organization's side is the placeholder showing the data that this backend function would use. I understand this might be frustrating. If you'd like to work on other aspects of the application that can be handled with client-side code, I'm ready to help! Or, if you have a way to set up the backend Cloud Function, I can guide you on what client-side adjustments would be needed to integrate with it."

The diff: - className=\"flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-background\" (Server rendered this) + className=\"page-transition-wrapper\" (Client rendered this for the same structural element) This suggests that on the server, the direct child of NotificationProvider was a loading spinner (div with spinner classes). However, on the client, AppProviders rendered the div.page-transition-wrapper in that same spot, which then contained the page content (which might itself be a spinner initially). This mismatch often occurs when client-side hooks like usePathname() are used in a component that affects the rendering structure, and its initial client-side value (before full hydration) differs from the server's, or leads to a different render tree. The key={pathname} on the wrapper div is particularly sensitive to this. To fix this, we'll ensure that the page-transition-wrapper (which depends on the client-side pathname for its key) is only rendered after the component has mounted on the client. On the server and during the initial client render (before useEffect runs), we'll render the children directly without this specific wrapper. This ensures the server render and the first client render match. Here's the updated src/contexts/AppProviders.tsx: b49db4c9 Restore This change ensures that the server-rendered output and the initial client-side render (before useEffect in AppProviders runs) are consistent. The page-transition-wrapper and its key={pathname} are only introduced on the client after the component has mounted, which is a standard way to resolve such hydration issues.

Let's apply this fix. 26645a90 Restore The primary issue in the student settings page was how skills and interests (which are transformed into arrays by Zod) were being assigned to the updatePayload.

Additionally, I've refined the logic for resetting the form after a successful save in onProfileSubmit. Instead of manually calling profileReset there, I've removed it and will rely on the existing useEffect hook (which listens to changes in the user object from AuthContext) to reset the form. This is a more standard react-hook-form pattern and ensures the form is reset with the definitively latest data from the context after an update. I've also added specific profileSetValue calls to clear the file inputs manually after a successful save, as reset doesn't always clear file inputs in the way we might expect. The disabled state for the save button logic (!profileIsDirty && !watchedAvatarFile?.length && !watchedResumeFile?.length) || profileIsSubmitting remains the same, as it correctly reflects the conditions under which the button should be active.

It's a NoSQL database optimized for storing structured data like text, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects (think of it like a big JSON document store). While it can technically store small binary data, it's highly inefficient, can quickly become expensive, and isn't practical for images or other large files. The standard way to handle images is: Upload the image file to a dedicated file storage service. For Firebase projects, the natural choice is Firebase Storage. Other cloud providers offer similar services (like Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3, etc.). Get a public URL for the uploaded image from the storage service. Store this URL (which is just a string) in Firestore in the user's profile document (e.g., in the avatarUrl field). Why we're using https://placehold.co/... right now: The current implementation uses placeholder URLs like https://placehold.co/100x100.png?text=G as a temporary stand-in. Implementing full image uploads to Firebase Storage involves: Setting up Firebase Storage in your project. Writing client-side code to handle the file selection, upload progress, and get the download URL back. Managing security rules for Firebase Storage. This is a more involved process. So, for prototyping and getting the basic profile update flow working, we're simulating the image change by updating the avatarUrl with a new placeholder. This confirms that the URL can be saved and changed in Firestore. If you'd like to implement actual image uploads using Firebase Storage, that would be the next step for this feature!

Given your app is already using Firebase for authentication and database, Firebase Storage is the most natural and recommended solution for this. It's designed to work seamlessly with other Firebase services. However, if you're curious about other conceptual approaches or simpler (though often more limited) alternatives, here are a few ideas: Firebase Storage (Recommended): How it works: You'd upload the actual image/PDF file from the user's browser directly to a Firebase Storage bucket. Firebase Storage then gives you a unique URL for that file (e.g., gs://your-bucket/path/to/image.jpg or a public HTTPS URL). You then store this URL string in Firestore (e.g., in the avatarUrl or resumeUrl field of your user document). Pros: Scalable, secure, designed for file hosting, integrates well with Firebase security rules, handles large files efficiently. This is the standard, robust solution for Firebase apps. Cons: Requires setting up Firebase Storage and adding client-side code for the upload process. Store as Data URIs (Limited use, mainly for very small images): How it works: An image file can be converted into a very long string called a Data URI (e.g., data:image/jpeg;base64,...). This string could theoretically be stored directly in a Firestore field. Pros: No separate storage service needed. Cons: Not suitable for PDFs or larger images. Firestore documents have size limits (around 1MB). Data URIs for images can get very large, very quickly, exceeding this limit. Inefficient for storage and retrieval in a database. Makes your Firestore documents bulky and slow to load. Generally only feasible for tiny icons or thumbnails, not user profile pictures or resumes. Link to External URLs (User-Provided): How it works: Instead of uploading a file, you could provide an input field where users paste a URL to an image or PDF they've hosted elsewhere (e.g., on their own website, a public Google Drive link, Imgur, etc.). Your application would then just store this user-provided URL string in Firestore. Pros: Simplest to implement on your end; no file handling or storage costs for you. Cons: You rely on the user to provide a valid, publicly accessible URL. The link might break if the user deletes the file or changes its permissions on the external service. Less control over the content and its availability. Might not be a great user experience for all users. Placeholder Services (Current Approach): How it works: This is what we're doing now with https://placehold.co/.... It's excellent for development and UI prototyping. Pros: Super easy, no backend setup needed. Cons: Not for actual user data storage. Given your current stack, Firebase Storage (Option 1) is the way to go for a production-ready solution. It directly addresses the need to store user-uploaded files efficiently and securely within the Firebase ecosystem.

Instead of a standalone page, you want students to be able to attach portfolio items (like links to projects, designs, or documents) directly to a specific job application. The hiring organization can then view these items when they review the application. This is a great idea as it allows students to tailor their supporting documents for each job. Here is my plan to implement this: Remove Standalone Portfolio Page: I will remove the \"Portfolio\" link from the student's navigation sidebar. The portfolio page itself will be reverted to a \"Coming Soon\" placeholder, effectively deprecating the old implementation. Update Data Structures: I'll modify the Application type to include an optional list of portfolio items, each with a title, description, and a URL. Enhance the Application Modal: On the internship detail page, I will modify the \"Apply\" pop-up. It will now include a new section where students can add, view, and remove portfolio items for that specific application. I'll add a secondary dialog for a clean \"Add Item\" form. Update the Organization's View: On the \"Received Applications\" page for organizations, I will update the application details modal to display the list of portfolio items submitted by the student, with clickable links. Add Translations: I'll add all new labels and text to the English and Mongolian locale files.

    "message": "That's an excellent question, and I apologize for not making the new workflow clearer. You are right to ask where students add their portfolio items now. Instead of a single, general portfolio page, students now add relevant portfolio items at the moment they apply for a specific job. This allows them to tailor which projects or links they share for each application. Here is the new process: A student finds a job on the Internship Details page (/student/internships/[id]). They click the \"Apply In-App\" button. The application pop-up window appears. Inside this window, there is now a new \"Portfolio / Supporting Documents\" section. The student can click the \"Add Portfolio Item\" button right there to add links to their work (like a GitHub repository, a design on Behance, or a document on Google Drive). This way, the portfolio items are part of the application itself, and the hiring organization will see the specific items the student chose to include for that job."

Here's the plan: Re-instate the Portfolio Page: I will build a dedicated page at /student/portfolio where students can add, view, and delete their portfolio projects. This will serve as their master list. Update the Application Modal: When a student applies for a job, the application modal will now fetch their master list of portfolio projects and display them as a checklist, allowing the student to select which specific projects to include with that application. Refine Data Structures: I'll consolidate the PortfolioItem type to be used for both the master list and the application submissions. Update Navigation & Translations: I'll add the \"Portfolio\" link back to the student's sidebar navigation and update the language files with all necessary text.

I'll adjust the styling for all the main pop-up components to make them lighter and use a more subtle blur effect. Here's the plan: Identify Pop-up Components: I will target the ...Content parts of Dialog, DropdownMenu, Popover, Select, Sheet, and Tooltip. Adjust Styling: For each of these components, I'll change the background classes from bg-popover/80 dark:bg-popover/70 backdrop-blur-md to bg-popover/95 dark:bg-popover/90 backdrop-blur-sm. This will: Increase the background opacity, making them less transparent and \"brighter.\" Reduce the blur from medium (-md) to small (-sm), making the effect more subtle.

    "message": "You are absolutely right to point that out, and thank you for the detailed screenshots. The issue is clearer now. My previous attempts were flawed because I was trying to apply the blur effect to the pop-up content itself, when for dialogs, it should be applied to the overlay behind the pop-up. The dark, non-blurry background you're seeing is caused by the DialogOverlay component, which was using a simple bg-black/80 class. I will now implement a comprehensive fix that correctly applies the \"glass\" effect to all pop-up-style components, respecting their individual structures: For Dialogs & Sheets: I'll change their ...Overlay components. Instead of a dark screen, the overlay will now be a semi-transparent, blurred version of the background. The DialogContent and SheetContent will have an opaque background so the text inside remains sharp and readable against the new blurry backdrop. For Dropdowns, Popovers, & Tooltips: These components don't have a separate overlay. For these, I will apply the semi-transparent background and the backdrop-blur effect directly to the ...Content element. This two-part strategy will create the consistent, bright, and clean \"glass\" effect you're looking for across the entire application. Here are the specific changes: 4e6ef752 Restore +1 more file"

I was trying to force a structured JSON output from a function that's designed to return plain text. Additionally, the way the AI model was configured by default could cause issues. I've prepared a comprehensive fix that addresses this and makes the other AI features more robust: Corrected the Chatbot Flow: I've rewritten the chatWithAssistantFlow to correctly call the AI model, get the plain text response, and then format it as expected by the chat UI. Updated AI Configuration: I've removed the global default model from src/ai/genkit.ts to prevent conflicts. Strengthened Other AI Flows: I've explicitly added the correct model configuration to the Resume Analyzer and Job Match flows to ensure they continue to work correctly.

That's why the assistant can't get a response. To fix this, you'll need to do the following: Get a free Google AI API key from Google AI Studio. Create a new file in the root of your project called .env.local. Add the following line to that new .env.local file, replacing YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with the key you just obtained: GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE In the meantime, I'll make a change to the code that will provide a much clearer error message if the API key is missing in the future. I am also adding a standard .gitignore file to your project to ensure your .env.local file (and other sensitive information) won't be accidentally shared. After these changes, once you add your API key, the assistant should work perfectly. c121591e Restore This change will make the app fail on startup with a clear message if the API key is missing, which is much better for debugging.
